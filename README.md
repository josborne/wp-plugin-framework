wp-plugin-framework
===================

A starting point for WordPress plugin development.

Class based plugin containing examples including:

- Creating admin menus
- Using Ajax on admin menus and front-end forms
- WordPress database interaction
- Actions and Filters
- Shortcodes
- Correctly passing JSON
- Correctly including Javascript files and values
- Including plugin action links
- Version based options updating

Code includes comments with descriptions on how things work.

### Planned updates

I'm planning on adding a few more features to this over time:

- Creating top level admin menus with sub menus
- Correctly using form NONCEs 
- How to create a fully extendible plugin (lots more hooks basically)
- More to come...
